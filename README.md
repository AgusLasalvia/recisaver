HELLO THERE ðŸ‘‹

My name is Agustin, and this is my first mobile app! ðŸš€

For this project, I decided to use React Native for the frontend and NestJS for the backend.

The goal of this app is to allow users to store and share their recipes easily. Users will be able to create new recipes and search for existing ones shared by others.

For data storage, the app uses MySQL to manage user information and recipes, while Firebase Storage is used to store images efficiently.

It's a simple app for now, but I plan to improve and expand it over time.

Hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
